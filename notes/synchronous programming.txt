synchronous programming 
	- execute one line at a time or statement at a time (single threaded)
	- asynchronous can skip lines due to delay

why is an unbalanced BST bad?
	- because in worst case scenarios, these trees have O(n) time for lookup 

Recursion:
	- can be used to make dcode more readable
	- can be costly in terms of time complexity and memory (stack overflow!)
	- anything you can do with recursion CAN be done with loops (iteratively!)
		- used in merge sort, quick sort, tree traversal, graph traversal!

Sorting Algorithms:
	- Bubble:
	- Insertion:
	- Selection:
	- Merge:
