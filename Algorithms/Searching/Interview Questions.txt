If you know a solution is not far from the root of the tree?
  BFS
If the tree is very wide?
  DFS, b/c BFS will need too much memory and it needs to keep track of nodes with a queue

If the tree is very deep and solutions are rare?
  BFS, because DFS will take a long time with this type of tree because it is deep, b/c
  solutions are rare, it will repeat

If the solutions are frequent but located deep in the tree?
  DFS, because you should be able to find it quicker

Determining whether a path exists between two nodes?
